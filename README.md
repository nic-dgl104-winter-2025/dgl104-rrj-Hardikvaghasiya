# Week 8 - Research and Reflection Journal


### **Research a New Language**
I explored **Haskell**, a functional programming language widely used in academia, financial modeling, and data analysis. 
- **Use cases:** High-assurance software, mathematical computations.
- **Users:** Researchers, data scientists, and software engineers.
- **Resources:** *Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!* and *Haskell.org* provide structured learning materials.

### **Reflection on Slack Responses**
Reading various posts on Slack highlighted the diversity of programming languages. I gained insights into Lua’s efficiency in game development and Processing’s accessibility for creative coding.

### **User Story for Spotify**
- *"As a user, I can create a playlist and add songs to it."*
- *"As a user, I can share my playlist with friends."*
- *"As a user, I can remove songs from my playlist."*

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The playlist feature should have a clear 'Create Playlist' button.
- Users should be able to search and add songs easily.
- A straightforward delete option should be available for removing songs.

### **Choosing a Programming Language for the Project**
**Selected Language:** **React Native**
- **Experience Level:** Moderate (one semester + personal projects).
- **Reason for Choice:** Allows for cross-platform mobile app development, providing flexibility.

### **Exploring GitHub Repositories**
Exploring open-source projects on GitHub revealed:
- Extensive **React Native repositories** for mobile development.
- Functional programming applications for expanding Haskell knowledge.
- UI/UX projects emphasizing user-friendly design.

### **Reflection**
1. **Key Insight:** Haskell’s functional nature reduces bugs, making it suitable for high-reliability software.
2. **Alternative Languages for DGL 104:** TypeScript and Dart due to their strong typing and mobile capabilities.
3. **GitHub Observations:** Open-source projects emphasize modularity and efficiency, showcasing best practices in collaborative coding.
